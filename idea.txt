i need to create a bitcoin price predictor using re enforecement learning

logic is to create a model we got the data now we have to reward the model based
on the data. compare real data with predicted data reward based on the difference
between the amount now real data is the sdata provided in the csv file the input
will be date and the output will the start amount. 

taking about the ui i need a ui where we can see the progress and how much reward is the model
getting how accurate is the prediction.
